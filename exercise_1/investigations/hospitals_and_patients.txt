Hospitals and Patients:

Finally, to determine whether patient survey values correlate to 
hospital scores or procedure variability, we must perform a pearson's 
correlation across a weighted grouping of survey values compared with 
our average scoring.

To do this we take the "hvbp_hcahps_05_28_2015" file, which is the most 
complete and general of all the survey data.  We then take a weighted 
average of each of the 24 survey values, and are careful to divide by 
either 10 or 9 as appropriate for the "out of" value.  We can now look 
to correlate these values with the hospital's overall score weightings:

Our pearson's R coefficient comes back as 0.1174033544842013.  This 
indicates a very weak correlation.

Unfortunatley, the survey data provided in the set for all of the 47 
procedure types independently is incomplete in both data sets and 
overall availability.  There is simply not enough data to produce 
relevant findings on a correlation with procedure variability, though we 
have the variability data available in isolation.

This approach is appropriate because it's leveraging actual 
correlational values between the weighted averages of the data sets for 
a particular attribute.
