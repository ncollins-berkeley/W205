Best_hospitals

The assignment indicates that we must go about finding the best 
hospitals by finding those that have "the most consistently high scores 
for a variety of procedures."  In medical terms, the only data in the 
data set that really focus on true procedures (in the realm of 
observations and interventions) are the files "Outpatient Imaging 
Efficiency - Hospital" which focuses on imaging procedures, and "Timely 
and Effective Care - Hospital" which contains a variety of general 
procedures.

Taking the scores in those files, one is able to devise a weighted 
heuristic based on looking at the overall min and max of each procedure 
and coming up with a weighted score (0 to 1 scale) for every procedure 
in those files.  One must be cautious to verify procedures for which a 
high value is better and procedures for which a low value is better.  
Once you throw out the missing and incomplete data, you're left with a 
core of these procedures.  By reading the provided documentation in the 
pdf, you can determine what the high/low attribute is for each one.  
(The specifics here are listed below.)

After you appropriately weight all the data on a 0 to 1 scale, you can 
then aggregate for specific hospitals to determine the overall "best 
hospitals" in the group.  I chose to require that, to be considered, 
hospitals had to at least have reported metrics for at least two-thirds 
(32 of 47) of these procedures.  Otherwise they were thrown out for not 
having provided enough data.  This may seem to introduce bias, though, 
we need an assurance that the hospital is fairly large and inclusive, 
and "best" is a biased term to begin with.  This reduces the set to 1976 
hospitals.  The best ten are indicated below.

This approach is appropriate because we are targeting measures that are 
specifically procedures, and finding an average value across the range 
of these procedures, weighting appropriately.
