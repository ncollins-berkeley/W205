Hospital Variability:

To determine procedure variability between hospitals, we take our 
weighted scores and now aggregate by procedure instead of hospital or 
state.  Then, instead of averaging the scores, we examine the variance 
within each procedure, among our 47 chosen procedure types.  The top 10 
most variant procedures are listed below with variance and counts.  This 
approach is appropriate because we are taking the statistical value of 
variance for each procedure based on weighted averages.  We only look at 
procedures that have at least 500 reported values from the pool of 4824 
hospitals to make sure there is a large enough sample that we're working 
with.
